question :Pseudocode Development - Task: Write a detailed pseudocode for a simple program that takes a number as input, calculates the square if it's even or the cube if it's odd, and then outputs the result. Incorporate conditional and looping constructs.
solution :

(1)
Take input value from a user
-Read input number.
-Then check a user enterd value is even number or odd number.
-check input number is even
         (checking even number - input_number%2 == 0)
          if number is even
         -calculate the square of the input number.
             square = input_number * input_number
         -output -> square number.
                  
 (2)            
          
start  
prompt the user to enter a number and store it in a variable
initialize a variable to store the result
check if the number is even 
calculate its square and store in variable
else
the number is odd
calculate its cube and store it in variable
show the result
 +result
