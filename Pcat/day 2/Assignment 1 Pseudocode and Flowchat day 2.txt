Assignment 1: Pseudocode and Flowchart for Sorting Algorithm - Write pseudocode and create a flowchart for a bubble sort algorithm. Provide a brief explanation of how the algorithm works and a simple array of integers to demonstrate a dry run of your algorithm.

solution:
for a bubble sort algorithm:

begin
	for i = 0 to M-1 do
	for j = 0 to M-1-i do
	if array[j] > array[j+1] then
	swap array[j] and array[j+1]
	end if
	end for
	end for
        end procedure



Array of integers to demonstrate a dry run of  bubble sort algorithm :
input:

0	1	2	3	4
23	10	16	11	20
After i=0

0	1	2	3	4
10	16	11	20	23
After i=1

0	1	2	3	4
10	11	16	20	23
After i=2

0	1	2	3	4
10	11	16	20	23
After i=3

0	1	2	3	4
10	11	16	20	23
After i=4

0	1	2	3	4
10	11	16	20	23

explanation of how the algorithm works:

We are given with an input array which is supposed to be sorted in ascending order
We start with the first element and i=0 index and check if the element present at i+1 is greater then we swap the elements at index i and i+1.
If above is not the case, then no swapping will take place.
Now  “ i ” gets incremented and the above 2 steps happen again until the array is exhausted.
We will ignore the last index as it is already sorted.
Now the largest element will be at the last index of the array.
Now we will again set i=0 and continue with the same steps that will eventually place second largest at second last place in the array. Now the last 2 indexes of the array are sorted.



























Bubble Sort algorithm includes the following steps:

1. Set N = Length of Array

2. Array[j] > Array[j + 1] (Decision)

if no - continue with the step 4
3. Swap Array[j] and Array[j+1]

4. Increment j (j++)

5. j < N - i - 1 (Decision)

if yes - continue with the step 2
6. Clear j (j = 0)

7. Increment i (i++)

8. i < N - 1 (Decision)

if yes continue with the step 2
9. Ordered Array
